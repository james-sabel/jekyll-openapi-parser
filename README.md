# Jekyll OpenAPI Parser: a Jekyll template for API docs

**Jekyll OpenAPI Parser** is a template for Jekyll that generates API reference documentation from an OpenAPI specification file (OAS v3.0).

This is a test project and it currently doesn't have full OAS support. (See [Template limitations](#template-limitations))

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository.

1. Run the following command in a terminal to build the project and start the local server:

    ```
    # bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

1. View the reference documentation website at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Requirements

* **Ruby with DevKit**
    * Linux - apt (Debian or Ubuntu):
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
    ```
    Or check out [this installation guide for other distros](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

## About this project

### Features

* Iterates a YAML file written in OpenAPI 3.0
* Methods (descriptions and request bodies)
* Responses (error code, description, model/schema and example)
* Three-panel format
* Collapsible sidebar
* Light and dark mode
* Fully responsive
* Includes a sample YAML file
    * The sample file is based on [ImgFlip's Meme Generator API documentation](https://imgflip.com/api). This file was created for demonstration only and it does not represent ImgFlip's official API.

### Usage

This template uses Jekyll's built-in Liquid integration to iterate through the specification file and generate the docs.

* Put the YAML file in the `_data` folder. You can use the project's default file or provide your own.
* Set the name of your specification file in the `data_source` variable located in the `reference.html` file, *without* the extension.
    * *Example:*

        Specification file: `meme_generator.yaml`

        Variable:
    
            {% assign data_source = "meme_generator" %}

### Template limitations

The current version of this template does *not* support:

* JSON files
* Multiple YAML files
* Every OpenAPI feature, such as References (`$ref`) and other things
